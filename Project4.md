## MEAN STACK DEPLOYMENT TO UBUNTU IN AWS

We are aware of the other application stacks (LAMP,LEMP, MERN) why MEAN ? Why is it so widely adopted, ?  The main reason for preferring MEAN stack over others is because of the use of a single language throughout the development i.e, for both client-side and server-side, since all these technologies are written in JavaScript, web development process becomes neat.

## WHAT IS THE MEAN STACK

MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.
 
 M - MongoDB ( Database)
 
 E - Express ( Back-end Web Framework)
 
 A - Angular (Front-end Framework)
